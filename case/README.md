# 3D printed case for Badger2040

A 3D-printed case has a slot for two CR2032 batteries. Badger 2040 runs
on RPi 2040. It is energy efficient, and batteries should last for a
long time. Also comes with a battery toggle switch to shut everything down.

## Assembly

Steps:
- 3D print top and bottom panels. PLA plastic is good enough.
- Disassemble & attach a 2xCR2032 battery holder

- Assemble the badge, use hot glue whenever applicable

## Known bugs

- A 3D model has minor misalignments that I did not bother to fix,
  e.g. a LED is 0.1-0.2mm off to the left.
